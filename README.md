# Pokemon-with-SwiftUI-Redux-MVVM

This is a simple, playground project where I will try to build a Pokedex app. This app will use the combine the following patterns and frameworks:
- [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) (targeting iOS 14.0)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org) for app state management
- [MVVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel) as the main pattern

To ensure keeping a clean syntax, I will use `SwiftLint` as a dependency (the dependency manager being Swift Package Manager).

Every step will be documented in this file.
